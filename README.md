# ArrayListProject
Luke, Franklin, and Ethan ArrayList Project 

In this project, we implemented the Node class to create the larger data structure, ArrayList. Our goal is to replicate the full functionality of the ArrayList built off of the previous data structures we've made in class. Furthermore, this project was designed to help us practice good GitHub habits and build on our source control knowledge and abilities.
